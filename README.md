Permutation Flow Shop Problem

Brief: A large car manufacturer, BWM, approaches you to optimise their production facilities. 

The production of a car involves it passing through a series of workstations, with workstations modifying the appearance of the car in some way (e.g. adding an engine/doors/lights/etc). Regardless of their type (e.g. saloon, estate, electric, convertible cars, etc), all cars go through the same workstations and in the same order. 

BWM wants you to find out what the most efficient processing order (permutation) of model types is within a single production facility. For example, should BWM first produce all saloon cars, then the estate cars, and then the electric ones, or should electric cars be produced before saloon cars and estate cars afterwards. 

The goal of an optimization algorithm applied to the PFSP is to find a sequence (permutation) of jobs S such that the makespan is as minimal as possible.
